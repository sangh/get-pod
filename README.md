This is my little script to have a podcast retrieval engine that does
everything I'd want it to and I couldn't find one that existed (at the time)
that does the following:

*  Can be called by cron or manually rather then something like "every 2 hours".
*  Can ask about a feed or a particular episode (in order!) and then
display information about it and then mark it or skip it or whatever for some
feeds and just get the others.
*  Will call a custom executable to do whatever with the d/l~ed file (in my case
I put it in my own rotation for my mp3 player).
